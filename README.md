## Project Overview
This project analyzes global COVID-19 data to understand the pandemic’s spread and impact across various countries and regions. By examining daily and cumulative case counts, deaths, and biweekly/monthly aggregates, this project seeks to highlight significant trends, potential correlations, and the effectiveness of policy interventions. The analysis includes data wrangling, descriptive statistics, and visualizations to provide a comprehensive overview of the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Contents
- **Part I-A: Data Exploration and Contextualisation**  
  We explore the dataset structure, examining the key variables and their significance. This section includes a comprehensive summary of the dataset, identifying missing values and presenting descriptive statistics for essential metrics like daily cases, weekly cases, and total deaths.

- **Part I-B: Data Processing and Functional Programming**  
  Using the Tidyverse packages, we performed various data wrangling tasks, including selecting variables, recoding missing values, and creating biweekly and monthly aggregations for cases and deaths. The code is modularized for reusability, with functions created to standardize missing value handling and calculate new metrics.

- **Part II-A: Data Visualization and Functional Programming**  
  We developed three visualizations to convey critical findings from the COVID-19 data:
  1. **Global Daily New Cases Over Time** – A time series showing pandemic surges.
  2. **Top 10 Countries by Total Cases** – A bar chart highlighting countries with the highest cumulative cases.
  3. **Correlation Between Total Cases and Deaths** – A scatter plot demonstrating the relationship between cases and deaths across regions.

- **Part II-C: Critical Engagement with AI**  
  We used ChatGPT to assist with code refinement, data wrangling, and visualization, optimizing syntax and ensuring compatibility with updated R packages. Reflections on ChatGPT’s contributions are documented, along with its limitations.

## Data Overview
The dataset, sourced from **Our World in Data**, includes COVID-19 statistics from 2020 through 2024, covering:
- **date**: Record date.
- **location**: Country or region.
- **new_cases**: Daily reported cases.
- **new_deaths**: Daily reported deaths.
- **total_cases** and **total_deaths**: Cumulative cases and deaths to date.
- **weekly_cases** and **weekly_deaths**: Counts over the last 7 days.
- **biweekly_cases** and **biweekly_deaths**: Counts over the last 14 days.

## Project Structure
- **report.qmd**: Main Quarto report file with full analysis, code, and interpretations.
- **data/**:
  - `full_data.csv`: Original dataset.
  - `full_data_with_changes.csv`: Processed dataset with biweekly and monthly aggregations.
- **scripts/**:
  - `calculate_changes.R`: Data wrangling and aggregation functions.
  - `visualizations.R`: Functions for generating visualizations.
- **figures/**: 
  - `daily_cases_plot`: Bar chart of global daily new cases over time.
  - `total_cases_by_country`: Horizontal Bar chart of top 10 countries and Regions with most cases in the world over time.
  - `Total_Cases_vs_Total_Deaths`: Scatter point plot of comparison of total cases and total deaths.
- **README.md**: Project instructions and details (this file).


## Usage Instructions

### Install required packages

```r
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "zoo", "pander", "ggplot2"))
```

### Load Data and Run Analysis:

Open report.qmd in RStudio and use Quarto to render it as a PDF or HTML report.

### Generate Visualizations:

Run visualizations.R to create and save plots of the dataset’s trends.

### Examine Processed Data:

The full_data_with_changes.csv file contains monthly and biweekly data, generated by running calculate_changes.R.

## Dependencies

- **tidyverse**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **zoo**: Rolling calculations for biweekly aggregations.
- **pander**: Markdown-friendly table rendering.
- **ggplot2**: Data visualization.
